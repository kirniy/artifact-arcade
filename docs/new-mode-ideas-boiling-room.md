## Arcade Modes

### 1. WANTED POSTER
Take a photo, AI generates a vintage "WANTED" poster with a bounty, fake crime ("Caught dancing too hard", "Wanted for stealing the vibe"), and a reward amount. Red & black distressed print aesthetic. Easy to share, funny, viral.

### 2. ALBUM COVER
Photo becomes a fake album cover. AI generates a genre (deep house, techno, drum & bass), a fake album title, tracklist of 4-6 songs with absurd names, and your DJ name. Dark moody aesthetic with typography. Could match the BOILING ROOM chrome ring style.

### 3. CROWD METER
No photo needed. The camera continuously watches the crowd. AI analyzes energy level and displays a live "boiling point" thermometer on the LED — from "lukewarm" to "BOILING OVER". Updates every 30 seconds. Fun ambient installation.

### 4. MEME MACHINE
Take a photo, AI generates a meme with your face. Top text / bottom text format or modern meme templates. Party-themed captions. Shareable via QR.

### 5. DANCE BATTLE JUDGE
Two people stand in front of the camera. They each get 10 seconds (countdown on LED). AI watches both rounds and declares a winner with a score breakdown: rhythm, energy, creativity, style. Results on screen + QR.

### 6. BARTENDER AI
No photo. Interactive menu on LED. Pick a mood (aggressive, chill, romantic, chaotic) using the button to cycle through options. AI generates a custom cocktail recipe with a creative name, ingredients, and instructions. Print or QR. Bartender can actually make it.

### 7. CONFESSIONAL
Type a confession on the phone (QR to web input) or select from pre-made prompts using the button. AI generates absolution, penance, or a dramatic monologue about your sin. Dark confessional booth aesthetic on LED. Anonymous, no photo.

### 8. TIME TRAVELER
Take a photo. AI places you in a different era — 1920s jazz club, 1970s disco, 1990s rave, 2050s cyber-club. Full scene generation with period-appropriate outfit, venue, and crowd. 4 eras = 4 different results per person.

### 9. SPIRIT ANIMAL DJ
Take a photo. AI determines your "spirit animal DJ" — what animal you'd be behind the decks. Generates an image of that animal DJing with your facial features subtly incorporated. Name + genre assigned.

### 10. VIBE CHECK
Quick mode. Camera snaps you, AI gives a one-word vibe rating displayed huge on the LED: "UNHINGED", "MAIN CHARACTER", "NPC", "VILLAIN ARC", "DELULU", "SLAY", etc. Simple, fast, funny. No waiting.

### 11. BATTLE CARD / STAT CARD
Photo becomes a trading card with stats: Attack, Defense, Vibe, Rizz, Chaos. Random special ability. Card has a rarity level (Common to Legendary). Collectible — people want to come back for a better pull.

### 12. SECURITY CAM
AI generates a fake security camera screenshot with your photo — timestamp, camera number, "SUSPECT IDENTIFIED" overlay, fake incident report text. Grainy, green-tinted CCTV aesthetic.

### 13. HEADLINE NEWS
Your photo becomes a breaking news broadcast screenshot. AI generates the headline, ticker text, and reporter name. "BREAKING: Local legend spotted at BOILING ROOM" style. News channel branding.

### 14. COUPLE COMPATIBILITY
Two people photo. AI generates a compatibility percentage, strengths ("both unhinged"), weaknesses ("neither can cook"), and a relationship forecast. Heart meter on LED during processing.

## Waiting Game Ideas (replace Santa Runner)

The waiting game plays on the 128x128 LED while AI generates the image (~15-30 seconds).

### A. PONG (recommended)
Classic Pong. One player vs AI or two-player if two buttons available. Dead simple, everyone knows the rules. Use big red button to move paddle up/down (alternate press = up, hold = down, or just auto-track with slight delay). Retro arcade feel matches the venue.

### B. SNAKE
Classic Snake game. Button changes direction (cycles: up, right, down, left). Simple, addictive, 128x128 is perfect for it. Score displayed on ticker.

### C. REACTION TIME
Screen flashes a color, you hit the button as fast as possible. Shows your reaction time in milliseconds. Leaderboard on ticker. Competitive, quick rounds fill the wait time.

### D. RHYTHM TAP
Dots fall from top of screen. Hit the button when they reach the bottom line. Synced to a simple beat. Score based on timing accuracy. Like a 1-bit rhythm game.

### E. BREAKOUT / BRICK BREAKER
Paddle at bottom, bricks at top. Button moves paddle left/right (alternating presses). Ball bounces. Classic, satisfying, fills time well.

### F. FLAPPY BIRD
Press button to flap. Pipes scroll. Everyone knows it. Frustrating enough to keep attention. Score on ticker.

### G. ASTEROID DODGE
Your dot is at the bottom. Asteroids fall. Button moves you left/right. Survive as long as possible. Speed increases. Simple, tense.

### H. VISUALIZER (non-game)
Skip the game entirely. Show a hypnotic visual effect — plasma, waveform, particle vortex — that pulses and morphs. Text on ticker: "AI is cooking..." or "Generating your image...". Ambient, no interaction needed. Good if people are drunk and don't want to play.

## Recommendations

**Best mode for this party:** #11 (Battle Card) or #1 (Wanted Poster) — fast, shareable, funny.

**Best waiting game:** A (Pong) or H (Visualizer) — Pong if you want interaction, Visualizer if you want ambient.
